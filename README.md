# Advent of Code 2022

This repository serves as a mono repository for the [Advent of Code 2022]((https://adventofcode.com/2022)) challenges. The tasks are completed and implemented in both Python 3 and C++.

**Python Solutions:** Utilises a data-analytic approach to the tasks and regards the input data as a table of data entries. The problems are solved with feature engineering and data manipulations using the data analysis library [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org).

**C++ Solutions:** Following a more traditional programming approach, solving the challanges in the simpliest way possible.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Update:**
Starting from the 7th, tasks will only be completed in EITHER pandas OR C++. Tasks requiring a great deal of data manipulation or external control flows will be implemented in C++, and any task fit for pandas will be implemented in Python.
